    "In all the programs we wrote till now, we have designed our program around functions i.e. blocks of statements which manipulate data. This is called the _procedure-oriented_ way of programming. There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object. This is called the _object oriented_ programming paradigm. Most of the time you can use procedural programming, but when writing large programs or have a problem that is better suited to this method, you can use object oriented programming techniques."

    "\n",
    "To use inheritance, we specify the base class names in a tuple following the class name in the class definition (for example, `class Teacher(SchoolMember)`).   Next, we observe that the `__init__` method of the base class is explicitly called using the  `self`  variable so that we can initialize the base class part of an instance in the subclass. This is very important to remember- Since we are defining a  `__init__`  method in `Teacher`  and  `Student`  subclasses, Python does not automatically call the constructor of the base class  `SchoolMember`, you have to explicitly call it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, if we have not defined an  `__init__`  method in a subclass, Python will call the constructor of the base class automatically."

    "While we could treat instances of `Teacher` or `Student` as we would an instance of `SchoolMember` and access the `tell` method of `SchoolMember` by simply typing `Teacher.tell` or `Student.tell`, we instead define another `tell` method in each subclass (using the `tell` method of `SchoolMember` for part of it) to tailor it for that subclass.  Because we have done this, when we write `Teacher.tell` Python uses the `tell` method for that subclass vs the superclass.  However, if we did not have a `tell` method in the subclass, Python would use the `tell` method in the superclass.  Python always starts looking for methods in the actual subclass type first, and if it doesnt find anything, it starts looking at the methods in the subclasss base classes, one by one in the order they are specified in the tuple (here we only have 1 base class, but you can have multiple base classes) in the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on terminology - if more than one class is listed in the inheritance tuple, then it is called **multiple inheritance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `end` parameter is used in the `print` function in the superclass's `tell()` method to print a line and allow the next print to continue on the same line. This is a trick to make `print` not print a `\\n` (newline) symbol at the end of the printing."
