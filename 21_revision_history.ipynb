    "I first started with Python when I needed to write an installer for software I had written called 'Diamond' so that I could make the installation easy. I had to choose between Python and Perl bindings for the Qt library. I did some research on the web and I came across [an article by Eric S. Raymond](http://www.python.org/about/success/esr/), a famous and respected hacker, where he talked about how Python had become his favorite programming language. I also found out that the PyQt bindings were more mature compared to Perl-Qt. So, I decided that Python was the language for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I started searching for a good book on Python. I couldn't find any!  I did find some O'Reilly books but they were either too expensive or were more like a reference manual than a guide. So, I settled for the documentation that came with Python. However, it was too brief and small. It did give a good idea about Python but was not complete. I managed with it since I had previous programming experience, but it was unsuitable for newbies.\n",
    "\n",
    "About six months after my first brush with Python, I installed the (then) latest Red Hat 9.0 Linux and I was playing around with KWord. I got excited about it and suddenly got the idea of writing some stuff on Python. I started writing a few pages but it quickly became 30 pages long. Then, I became serious about making it more useful in a book form. After a _lot_ of rewrites, it has reached a stage where it has become a useful guide to learning the Python language.  I consider this book to be my contribution and tribute to the open source community.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book started out as my personal notes on Python and I still consider it in the same way, although I've taken a lot of effort to make it more palatable to others :)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the true spirit of open source, I have received lots of constructive suggestions, criticisms and [feedback](./README.md#who-reads-bop) from enthusiastic readers which has helped me improve this book a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Status Of The Book\n",
    "\n",
    "The book needs the help of its readers such as yourselves to point out any parts of the book which are not good, not comprehensible or are simply wrong. Please [write to the main author]({{ book.contactUrl }}) or the respective [translators](./translations.md#translations) with your comments and suggestions.\n",
